**LEXINGTON** -- At 11:43AM on Tuesday, October 20th, Lexington freshman Jeremy Loring officially qualified for the Boston Marathon on LHS' own 26.2 mile course that contours the Californian-style school. "I was just absolutely bewildered," reported Mr. Loring. "I didn't even know I was being watched." Loring's guidance counselor told us that he signed Loring up for the race after observing his sub-4 minute mile pace during passing time in the early weeks of first quarter. "The kid showed promise," Counselor Daneovich told us.

The qualifying course includes 16 laps around the Quad, a loop through the freshman portables and freshman wing, library, the ladder on the auditorium wall, Commons One, Commons Two, and both small hills leading from the drop-off circle to the Quad.

Loring and his friends were able to push their pace so aggressively as a result of the strict five minute passing time between each class. Despite taking much more than the typical LHS freshman course load, Loring attributed much of his success to the multiple Advanced Placement and Honors classes that he had enrolled in. Loring told our reporters: "Thanks to my AP Biology class, I was able to optimize my running capacity; by maximizing the norepinephrine being released through my sympathetic nervous system, I rendered the temporary inhibition of certain metabolic pathways to sustain my run."

Loring's progress throughout the day was carefully monitored by student race marshalls disguised as trees. The exact distance Loring ran was calculated using kinematics equations, a photogate, and vector component modeling that included distances covered as Loring side-stepped upperclassmen slothing through the halls during frees. After a mere two hours and fifty seven minutes, Loring had completed exactly 26.2 miles between classes and first lunch.

As a result of his success, the LHS administration has put forth an effort to support and encourage other ambitious freshmen. In conjunction with the Boston Athletic Association, LHS has announced the transition of English classes to an entirely new building. Located far off campus next to the Lexington Reservoir, it will provide freshman with the high intensity training necessary for marathons as well as housing LHS' highly regarded English department. "This way, all students will have the opportunity to embed exercise into their busy schedules." said Ms. Flannagan, the Vice Principal.
