*Stupid flowchart.*

In a stunning display of utter idiocy, Lexington High School teacher Ms. Take posted a flowchart meme decrying the all-powerful Seniors Who Got Into Harvard.

The stupid idiot also went onto say that the genius Ivy League whiz-kids who will most likely run the fucking world someday, goddammit, “aren’t better or worse than anyone else”.

She later went on to foolishly imply that a student's GPA had "nothing to do with one's self worth as a person".

Along with a futile attempt to bring down the Most Holy down to her own level as a lowly person who has dedicated themselves to a meaningful life of educating and enriching the lives of young peoples, Ms. Take told the idiots who didn’t get accepted into college that they, too, “are human”.
