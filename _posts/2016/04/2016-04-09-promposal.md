*Who is She?*

Admit it, you’ve seen them walking to class, hand in hand, pausing every few steps to gaze longingly into each other’s eyes. You may have even glanced around Commons I only to catch sight of them sitting alone at a table, together, feeding each other smiley face fries and tossing each other’s salads. Everyone knows his name -- it’s Mark Owen, captain of the soccer team, Middlesex League All-Star and All-Scholastic in basketball, and varsity lacrosse player.

But Who Is *She*? If you’re dying to know, don’t worry, you’re just like every other student at LHS.

*“I think there should be a google spreadsheet shared over FirstClass that lists who everyone is going with to prom so we know who’s taken.”*\\
