*The official food of Senior Skip Day and one dumb fucking joke.*

It’s Senior Skip Day! Haven’t got anything planned? No problem. Here at the Muskeeto, we do the thinking, so you don't have to:

1. **Become an investment banker** -- With an entry salary of up to $150,000 annually (after bonuses), there’s no excuse for not becoming a highly paid Wall Street investment banker on your one day off.
1. **Steal Matt Damon’s identity** -- You’ve always wanted to star in “The Martian” and “Bourne Identity”. And hey, it’s _Senior Skip Day_, there are no rules; become the Emmy-nominated Matt Damon and take your rightful place on the throne.
1. **Administer the serum.**
1. **Befriend a snake** -- You like dogs, and what is a snake but a long, scaly dog? Take time off this Monday and find yourself a legless, reptilian friend.
1. **Grow out a manbun.** -- _Senior Skip Day_ is the perfect time for you to get this fashionable and highly desirable hairstyle.
1. **Pretend not to sneeze.** -- You can feel one coming on, but now's really not the time to be sneezing.
1. **Go to school.** -- Lexington is the pinnacle of the K-12 public education system, with one of the strongest performing programs in the state and the country. Making use of your extra time on _Senior Skip Day_ to attend high school would be a great way to take advantage of our town's high ranking academics.
1. **Celebrate your bat mitzvah.**
