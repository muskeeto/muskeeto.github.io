*It's movie time.*

Whether it's putting your feet up for a leisurely film-watching session, or gearing up for that intense movie marathon, these are The Muskeeto’s top picks for summer flicks.

10. **White Chicks**
	Want a romantic comedy to share with your lover on that special evening? This 100% politically-correct classic will satisfy your every desire. With multiple Grammy’s in the bag, this hit cult film will make you want to saddle up and ride into the depths of the Indian Ocean.
9. **Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's (Philosopher’s) Stone**
	“The horror film that shaped a generation” - Rolling Bone. Lifelike dream sequences and gypsy magic will leave you questioning reality for months.
8. **Moneyball**
	If you’re looking to pass your high school statistics class then boy, is this movie for you. The fat kid from “Superbad” will teach you all about deviations and numbers, et cetera, only for you to lose yourself in Brad Pitt’s deep blue eyes.
7. **Finding Nemo**
This thrilling prequel to the fan favorite “American Psycho” will have you screaming “Die, Bitch, Die!!!!” every time. Spoiler alert: Dory dies in Chapter 6.
6. **Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants**
	Demonstrating 21st Century body shaming at its finest, this film is about a pair of pants that should clearly not fit the four protagonists but somehow does, and in doing so, highlights the clear differences and flaws of said girls.
5. **Die Hard 2**
	From the series that brought you the best catchphrase of the twentieth century, this thought provoking film combines the philosophical rigor of “Fever Pitch” with the heart-wrenching romance of “The Notebook”.
4. **The Shining**
	“One of the greatest musicals of all time” - Mom. This family-friendly theatrical spectacle will have you singing and dancing for weeks. With such classic tunes as “I’m Chopping Down the Door with This Axe” and “My Family Is Terrified Of The Person I’ve Become,” The Shining will leave your head spinning for weeks.
3. **Marley and Me**
	The comedic event of the century, this laugh-out-loud, action-packed saga will give you appendicitis. The Muskeeto rates this film 8.4/10 for first dates. You'll probably go out and buy at least one turtle after watching it, too.
2. **Mean Girls 2**
	“A sequel that excites” -Mark Solomon. A revolutionary follow up to the small business office hit, this one teaches teens how to become functioning members of society and react positively to judgement (haters).
1. **Forrest Gump**
	Pre-admit yourself to the hospital because it's sure to be a wild ride. When a cooking competition comes to his hometown, a young chocolatier recounts tales of his previous life to woo the judges. Bringing you such quotable lines as “Bake, Forest, Bake” and “Yes..?” you’ll want to skip rocks across a pond this Fourth of July after watching this gut-wrenching flick.
