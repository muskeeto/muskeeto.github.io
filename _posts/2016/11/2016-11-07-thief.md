*On Left: Marshall’s Arrest Charge*

School administrators hope that a recent string of locker room thefts will come to an end with the arraignment of the culprit, LHS Junior Jack Marshall. Officials believe Marshall was able to pick combination locks and get into the lockers using a lock-pick that was found on his person at the time of arrest.

However, the question that has yet to be answered is how a minor acquired this item, given its cost of upwards of 20 Runescape coins. Some have theorized that Marshall used his level 53 thieving to pickpocket a bandit. Others believe Marshall may have come across the lock-pick in the Yanille Agility Dungeon, just below the lair of Salarin the Twisted. However, Lexington detectives view this possibility as unlikely, due to the level 67 agility required to access this dungeon.

Given the local Junior’s wealthy background, Dodgy Derek’s Dirty Deals is perhaps the most likely source, as lock-picks can be purchased on the regular at the store by well-off and knowledgeable players.
