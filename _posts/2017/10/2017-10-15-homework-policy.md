*Lexington, MA* –- Much to the chagrin of teachers, the start of the school year has seen numerous homework-free nights thanks to the newly implemented LHS homework policy. Although students agree it is a step in the right direction, some activists hope to see more change in the future.

On Wednesday, LHS student Desmond Krinklbacker submitted a motion to the town’s School Board to prevent teachers from checking or assigning homework on any day, on account of various holidays.

In an exclusive interview with the Muskeeto, Krinklbacker energetically explained that it would be “a huge step towards the inclusion and acceptance of all beliefs and cultures present in the LHS community.” He went on to question how the school could possibly “maintain any semblance of moral integrity while allowing homework-free nights of celebration for Good Friday or Rosh Hashanah, but not National Garlic Lovers’ Day or Speak Like A Pirate Day?”

Desmond’s classmate Ethel O’Sullivan professed her support of Desmond’s crusade for equality - “Last year I had to finish on an Italian project on National Take Your Houseplant for a Walk Day! How can I be expected to clean up after my azalea and keep her on leash while simultaneously conjugating verbs?” Other students were particularly frustrated with the burden of homework obstructing their observance of World Naked Day. “I can’t observe my nudist beliefs and also get jump start on my homework in the library!” senior Newt Tist raged. Tist, inspired by Buzzfeed Politics videos on his facebook feed, had filed a religious freedom suit at the time of writing.

Despite new principal Randall Martinez’s backing, “If the students of LHS want to create a better community for their peers, I’m all for it!”, the motion is expected to face a tough battle in the cutthroat legislative environment of the Lexington School Board. In a good omen for Krinklbacker’s prospects, one of the School Board’s focus groups has concluded that mindlessly scrolling through facebook late at night without homework to do is drastically less stressful than mindlessly scrolling through facebook late at night with homework to do. “Hopefully, these results will push the School Board to incorporate all holidays under the homework policy,” Krinklbacker remarked, remaining optimistic, “if we persevere for this cause, I believe that we will win and achieve justice.” Desmond plans to raise awareness by not doing any of his homework next week. “In honor of Plan Your Epitaph Day, Clean Your Refrigerator Day, National Peach Cobbler Day, National Kazoo Day, and Bubble Wrap Appreciation Day, I will not be doing any of my homework.” Although he knows that it is a risky move, Desmond is confident that his teachers will be “understanding”.
