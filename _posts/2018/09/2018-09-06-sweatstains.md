*Democracy dies in darkness*

*Second floor, Science Building* -- As the details slowly emerge and higher powers continue to level a brutal assault of heat upon the town, one thing is clear: No one is safe. 

Yes, your physics teacher is perspiring heavily. No, his choice of a dark, heathered blue-grey, cotton, sweat-wicking tee did not save him. Nor did his doctoral degree or spiffy lab coat, or even the cool way he sticks that pencil behind his ear. 

Physics maestro Mr. Davis wants to raise his arm up high to turn on the SMART board? Mother nature thinks otherwise. Yes, two can play that game Mr. Davis. The great equalizer, the anger of August, stainer of souls, that dreaded arm-pit perspiration, has once again brought the mighty to their knees. 

Consider yourself warned.
