<span class="quoteContent"> “The texture of the rice is simply unctuous, giving it poor mouthfeel, and I have really high standards for lunch. That’s why I prefer to wait in line for the first half hour of lunch every single day to order the exact same grilled sandwich that I have to eat as quick as possible without tasting or enjoying it.”</span>

Because the Muskeeto is a top notch news source, we will remain impartial, refraining from coming to a conclusion based solely upon the whims of the masses. That being said, we’d like to thank all of these real people (not actors) who took the time to write a review. We’d also encourage all of our readers to grab a snorkel and dive into the depths of the Frait Express to uncover some buried sushi to try for themselves.
