*Burlington AMC Cinema* -- Mission Impossible: Fallout opens strong, right out of the gate hitting you with the excitement and twists that have become hallmarks of the franchise. However, the film really started feeling flat right about the time I spied my girl with some guy two rows ahead of me. 

As a fan of both the series and my girlfriend, I was disappointed by what ended up being quite the cinematic and emotional disaster. The film’s first act was no doubt engaging and kept me right on the edge of my seat. That being said, it became very difficult for me to focus on whatever Tom Cruise was doing when I realized that the guy making out with my girlfriend was Brad from my chemistry class. A cool athlete or talented singer I could live with, but Brad? The kid couldn’t find the equilibrium point in a titration if it pulled a Tom Cruise and rammed him with a military-grade attack helicopter. 

Anyway, tonally inconsistent, not to mention confusing and unengaging, the movie finishes with a fight scene that seemed to care little for my relationship, which lay broken at my feet among the scattered remains of my spilled popcorn. Throughout the second half, as the truth about my place in the world started to become clear, the cinematography became quite lackluster, as the screen started looking blurry and wet – not really sure how they missed that one in the post-production process. 

It seemed to me a huge directorial oversight to give this reviewer the trusting nature necessary to cultivate a loving relationship with such a harlot: sloppy filmmaking at its worst. 

At the end of the day, I’d have to give *Mission Impossible: Fallout*  3/10 stars. Could’ve been much higher, but for some reason the movie just seemed to somehow spiral out of control. For prospective viewers, I’d recommend catching the first 40 minutes but make sure to leave early, and definitely return to a life of blissful ignorance. As for Brad, 2/10 stars: seems like a good kisser, not much else going for him.
