*Technically, the real name of the novel is "Modern Prometheus"*

*Humanities Wing, October 31st* -- Local Sophomore Max Rockatansky is universally beloved as a friend and classmate. His peers describe him as easy-going and fun to be around. Teachers note Rockatansky as someone who always contributes meaningful comments to classroom discussions. Even admirers and acquaintances have nothing but good to say, characterizing him as someone sure to be fun at parties. 

On the afternoon of October 31st, while reading Mary Shelley’s legendary novel Frankenstein in English class, Rockatansky stopped a hapless classmate in his tracks when the unfortunate fellow described “Frankenstein” as having “all the stitches and the green face and stuff.” Jabbing one finger pointedly into the air, eyebrows raised, a slight sneer creeping onto his face, Rockatansky blurted out, “well technically, it’s Frankenstein’s monster. Frankenstein was the scientist.” 

Around the class, students and teacher alike shared thoughtful looks and nods, all thinking about how this wonderfully insightful comment fit everything they knew about their sharp and easygoing friend Max. Fun at parties? Check. Super witty and awesome? Check.

Rockatansky's teacher Mr. Rictus would later glowingly recount this contribution to the other teachers in the teacher’s lounge. “You know, we really couldn’t have continued our discussion had Max not condescendingly insisted we follow obscure technicalities over the phrase a staggering majority of the world uses.” 

In Commons, Max’s friends also discussed the proverbial savior Max had become. Had it not been for him, a fellow classmate may have spent the rest of class ignorant to their own inane mistake. In accordance to this kind act Max had performed, his friends passed around a card, which they asked each student to sign as a symbol of gratitude. Max might have been popular before, but his ability to parse out information meaningful to everyone in a calm, witty, and kind manner sure has rocketed his standing. The sight of his name on the library sign-in sheet alone is enough to make most of the student body, not to mention awed administrators, swoon. 

Dr. Stevens himself came over the intercom to recognizing just how much Max had given back to the community in one single sentence. Dr. Stevens ended his announcement on a sententious note, reminding LHS: “while we may live in a society, Max works hard to make sure we live in a community”
