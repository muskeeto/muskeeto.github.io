    <p>As is custom at Lexington High School, the small demographic of the student body who are designated as superior to all other students are awarded the honor of standing around in the Senior Corner for seemingly the entire day holding cups of coffee. It is also generally tradition for the male representatives in this elite class to continue the legacy of bombarding the plebeians bustling to and fro with snowballs. One such plebeian was the recipient of this icy onslaught just prior to homeroom last Thursday.</p>

<em>Watch out!</em></p>

<p>“I had just broken into a brisk semi-jog as there were only three minutes left in passing time, when suddenly, out of nowhere, I felt a it smash into my face.”</p>

<p>Eye witness reports say the Freshman was initially startled, then appeared to get upset, before growing increasingly excited as he realized the source of the projectile.</p>

<p>“I mean, you don’t just throw a snowball at someone unless you dislike them. And you don’t dislike someone unless you know who they are. So those guys must know who I am!”</p>

<p>The Freshman could not comment further as he suddenly remembered he needed to return his library pass to his study hall teacher. Unconfirmed reports indicate the Freshman tried to come up with some kind of witty retort in response to the snowball, produced several monosyllabic sounds as he fumbled for words, then gave up and hurried away.
“It was really funny at first,” said a nearby Junior. She never finished her statement.</p>
