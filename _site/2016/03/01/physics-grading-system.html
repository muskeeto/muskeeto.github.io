<!--
**LEXINGTON** - In attempt to dodge the possibility of looking like a total tryhard or an getting the ever so dreadful "A", 12th-grade students at Lexington High School told Muskeeto reporters on Thursday that they were thankful for the implementation of the AP physics 1 grading system. “I was worried that the Bunker Hill community college would reject me if my grades got any higher”, stated Jofundus Quantifundomos Sr. Jr., who previously had a 4.1 GPA. “Balance is an important element of life: one boob is an A cup so the other is a D. And using that methodology we can extrapolate a similar balance: A in Kinematics? Complement that with a nice D in Forces.

More importantly, AP Physics 1 is teaching young students important skills. “I can now calculate the distance and time it takes for me to fall, after I jump off a bridge.” stated stated one particularly enthusiastic, anonymous student.

The grading system has truly exceeded all bounds. It has become the driving force that binds science to the arts. “It is the art of filling in the anorexic rectangles on the Scantron. With a gray-black 4B pencil of course.” Principal of LHS and Commander in Chief of the Dark Arts, Forniforus Hemingway XIVIXX, was so enlightened by the artistic lens through which physics could be interpreted, that he decided to give students art credits for taking the rigorous course.

When we interviewed senior Kendra Lamar, she expounded upon the wonders AP Physics I has done for her social life. She and her friends allegedly “hang out” there every day after school for physics test corrections. “Ooh! And there are always such cute boys there too, I’d let them take my derivative so they can lie tangent to my curves…”

Dr. Spoon reported that the system has been devised to teach students survival skills: how to succeed with what you have. “In hopes of challenging our students, we give them practice packets that have nothing to do with the actual test!  This way, the students can practice resourcefulness and use their vast prior knowledge on the acceleration of a teal triple spring on a pendulum in a closed system with a friction coefficient of -0.483 and a pH of 9.6!”

Furthermore, the class is intended to be an LHS replication of the famous Darwinian principle of natural selection. Survival of the fittest. This model was copied from the popular “gym” classes at LHS. Those who succeed carry on. Those who don’t, live as schmucks, painting themselves orange and impersonating carrots as they roll in dirt, longing for the soft touch of a tender bunny rabbit who will nibble on their supple skin.

“Additionally, I have now fully memorized my student ID, the eight crucial digits to my graduation and have grown increasingly blind due to hot pink equations sheet. “At least now I can’t see the BG on the lab she’ll pass back tomorrow. If I don’t see the grade, it doesn’t exist, right?’ Nishcoosina Wanterfoot wrote in her will before she died in an elevator problem in packet 3.

The ever so elusive B- can only be achieved with getting an NI on any of the 10 categories or “threads.” Even if you have “mastered” every other thread, the forgiving system will reward you with an overall grade of an NI. However the NI grade is used only in very rare instances for the recognition of truly exceptional achievement. We pray for those that take the next test. May the force be with you. -->
