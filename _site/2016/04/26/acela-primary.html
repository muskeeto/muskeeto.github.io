<em>Students rally together in support of Sanders.</em></p>

<p><strong>LEXINGTON</strong> – The polls closed at 8:00 PM Eastern time on Tuesday night, right as Lexington
high students were finishing their last supper before the Armageddon. Students were reportedly
horrified at seeing Trump and Clinton again in the lead, but not as surprised as they had been at the beginning of the primaries. Junior Carly Teller attests:</p>

<p>“On Super Tuesday, we still had hope. We took the loss as a sign to keep pushing, to keep
protesting. But in the last two months, we’ve matured. The disillusionment was painful at first,
but we made it through. We rejected the signs telling us that reform was around the corner. We
realized that no matter how hard we wished it to be true, Bernie Sanders was, and is, simply not
electable. So we’ve changed our message: why elect him? Let’s stage a revolution and make him
our messianic dictator!”</p>

<p>Pamphlets passed out at Lincoln Field during the daily local protest were found strewn about
town center after the disastrous performance by Sanders, with titles such as “DEMOCRACY IS
DEAD” and “RESISTANCE IS FUTILE – REVOLT NOW!”</p>

<p>Seniors staking out in cars for Assassins were advised to tune in to a local undisclosed radio
station. The sweet sounds of revolution emanated from vehicles nestled in illegal parking areas
throughout the town. The ringleader of the operation was indecipherable from the garbled
recording, but their message rang loud and clear: this was the last straw. The time is now.</p>

<p>At press time, three more seniors had been disqualified from the Assassins, but didn’t seem to
mind: bigger dreams lay on the horizon. As a light breeze graced Lincoln Field, a soft murmur
was heard: “we have to uproot the system and start anew.” Godspeed, comrades.</p>
