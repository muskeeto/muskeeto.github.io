Guidelines for Content Submissions
==================================

The Muskeeto is all about good content. Unfortunately, that means there is no guarantee that we will publish your work, but most submissions have been accepted and published. Here are a few guidelines and suggestions:

- Make sure your writing is high qual (take a look at the sources below or read the Muskeeto for examples)
- No targeting students / faculty
- No using real names (without explicit consent)
- No plagarism trash
- dont be a dick and stuff
- etc you get the idea whatever
